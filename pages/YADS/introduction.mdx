# Yet Another Design System (YADS)
 
Yet Another Design System (YADS) - Work In Progress. 

## What is YADS?

YADS is a figma-file design system, built based on atomic design principles and other ux methadology, referencing existing open-source libraries and standards.

By basing the design system on a standard such as Tailwind CSS, YADS hope to be flexible and scalable enough that other prebuilt components or ui libraries can easily be incorporated.

## Who can benefit from YADS?

YADS is built with the intention to help designers and developers alike, and would benefit someone with some knowledge on both design and development the most.

## Why another design system?

There already exists plenty of design systems and ui libraries. However, these deisgn systems typically split their templates and components up and are hidden behind paywalls.

Furthermore, these resources primarily cater to developers and designers have a harder time modifying and editing these said templates. YADS hopes to leverage existing open-source standards or libraries and provide higher order widgets/components/pages/sites.

Since people have already created and are using standards such as tailwind css and also prebuilt components such as shad/ui, YADS leverages on such resources to hopefully provide a library with templates and examples, and improve both the design and development process.
