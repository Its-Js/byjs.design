# About Me

I'm Jiang Shan (Js) and I am currently working as a sole product/uiux designer.

## Experience

I have primarily been designing cross-platform, responsive webapps and websites in the B2B space. Due to the nature of the projects, I am unable to showcase any of the actual designs.

- Current Employment - I work on B2B projects and am involved in both the planning and designing of said projects.
- Internship - I desgined a mobile application for taking care of the elderly and a [cross-platform application for workplace safety](https://www.vulcanworks.ai)
where I had to design for desktop, mobile and even wearables.
- Personal Proejct - For my FYP, I designed and developed a [cross-platform note taking application](https://hdl.handle.net/10356/167387).

## Design Philosophy

My personal values for designs:

1. Utility - Is it useful?
2. Practicality - Is it practical?
3. Simplicity - Is it easy to use/understand?

## Design Styles

Here are some of the design styles that I enjoy

- Minimalism
- Brutalism
- Neo-Brutalism

## Reflection

- Starting out, my focus was on delivering designs and working on **user requirements**.

- Moving on, I realized that there was a need to account for the **technical capabilities**.

- Progressing further, I have to balance **business requirements** on top of the other considerations.

My key takeaway has to be the shift in perspective, from only design to business, product development and design.
